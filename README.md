# SpaceNet 6 Baseline

This is the baseline algorithm for the [SpaceNet 6 Challenge](https://spacenet.ai/sn6-challenge/): multi-sensor all-weather mapping with electro-optical imagery and synthetic aperture radar imagery.  This baseline is built with the [Solaris](https://github.com/CosmiQ/solaris) geospatial deep learning library, and it follows the [format](https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/30116975) for a SpaceNet 6 submitted code.
